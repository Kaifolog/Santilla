Fine-tuned BERT classifier and fine-tuned T5 containerized with docker compose.

The datasets are composed of chats with my friends (so they are private). The classifier was trained to determine whether a message was written by my particular friend or not. T5 was fine-tuned to mimic this friend's writing style.
